                        Currently employed at <b>WolfWare</b>, where we provide software solutions to a wide variety of
                        clients. I am the lead developer in a number of projects, and am responsible for overseeing
                        project architecture and design, as well as actually writing code.

                    <p>
                        As for writing code, I've primarily acted as a full-stack engineer, designing front-end web
                        interfaces with <b>Svelte</b> and backend systems in <b>Node</b> and <b>PgSQL</b>. I also
                        maintain our small <b>AWS</b> cloud infrastructure.

                    <p>
                        We're a small company, so I take on a wide variety of responsibilities, which I find to be
                        rather interesting.

                        Working on a wide variety of freelance projects, mostly relating to the development of

            <p>
                I believe in fast and performant software as a requirement. User experience trumps all else, and every
                human has a visceral feeling for sluggishness.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that engineers function best when acting as generalists in small teams, where each member has
                a holistic understanding of the goal.
            </p>
            <p>I deeply enjoy independence, experimentation, and iterating quickly.</p>

            <p>
                Because of historical clerical errors and transliteration weirdness, my surname can be alternatively
                spelled as <b>Calasan</b>, <b>Chalasan</b> or <b>Kjalasan</b>. Any records relating to one of these
                surnames are indeed related to me.
