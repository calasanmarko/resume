            <p>
                I believe in fast and performant software as a requirement. User experience trumps all else, and every
                human has a visceral feeling for sluggishness.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that engineers function best when acting as generalists in small teams, where each member has
                a holistic understanding of the goal.
            </p>
            <p>I deeply enjoy independence, experimentation, and iterating quickly.</p>

                Because of historical clerical errors and transliteration weirdness, my surname can be alternatively
                spelled as <b>Calasan</b>, <b>Chalasan</b> or <b>Kjalasan</b>. Any records relating to one of these
                surnames are indeed related to me.
